# Temp-Sensor

This Arduino program is intended to initialize and test the DS18B20 temperature sensor on an Arduino Uno, and has been verified to work.

Associated documention and resources for debugging:
- Elegoo's 37 Sensor Kit Tutorial PDF (Page 71)

Tips:
- If the sensor outputs a reading of -127 degrees, then the sensor is fried and a new one should be replaced.
